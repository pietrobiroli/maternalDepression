## How to replicate the results
### STEP 1:
- Download and unpack the zip file into a preferred location.
- Folder should contain the following elements
  -  folders:
      -  dataClean/
      -  figures/
      -  figures/coefficientPlot/
      -  figures/preExisting
      -  logfiles/
      -  tables/

  -  execution files:
      -  README.md
      -  README.pdf
      -  00_runall.do
      -  THP_analysis.do
      -  THP_cleandata.do
      -  THP_mergedata.do
      -  THP_label_variables.do
      -  _gweightave.ado
      -  pstar.ado
      -  randcmd.ado
      -  randcmd.sthlp
      -  stepdownB.ado
      -  stepdownrandcmd.ado
      -  figures/coefficientPlot/coefplot_all.do

  -  data files:
      -  dataClean/THP_clean.csv
      -  dataClean/THP_clean.dta

### DATA ACCESS:
The replication files contain a publically available, cleaned, and anonymized dataset, THP_clean.dta, which can be used to run the replication code in THP_analysis.do. Files THP_mergedata.do and THP_cleandata.do merge and clean raw data to produce THP_clean.dta.

The raw data for this project are confidential and not publically available, but may be made accessible with Data Use Agreements with the Human Development Research Foundation http://hdrfoundation.org/. Researchers interested in access to the data may contact Victoria Baranov at victoria.baranov@unimelb.edu.au. It can take some months to negotiate data use agreements and gain access to the data. Completion of human subject research training may also be required (https://citiprogram.org). The author will assist with any reasonable replication attempts for two years following publication.


### STEP 2:
  - Open 00_runall.do in Stata
  - Change the "global maindir" location to the path on your computer where you downloaded the data
  - run 00_runall.do: this will run the data analysis, probably over serval days, and produce all of the
 output presented in the paper.
  - To obtain only a subset of the output, open THP_analysis.do and set the switches to 1 or 0 accordingly
  - To make the code run faster, open THP_analysis.do and change "global iterations" to a lower number (e.g.
 10). This change will impact the p-values calculated with randomization inference and/or the stepdown procedure reported in the tables and in Figure 2. It might also create errors in estimating the quantile treatment effects.


## Description of the code
### NOT FOR REPLICATION:

0. THP_mergedata.do --
This file merges the raw data and ensures that the publically available data contains no confidential information. The raw datasets are not included as they all contain identifying information on respondents and health workers.


1. THP_cleandata.do -- This file starts from the merged data and cleans it for the analysis
    * This file will use the following inputs
        * /dataRaw/THP_merge.dta

    * This file will produce the following outputs
        * /dataClean/THP_clean.dta
        * /dataClean/THP_clean.csv

    * commands needed:
        * _gweightave (from https://github.com/PrincetonBPL/ado-gallery)
        * mat2txt
        * xtgraph
        * zanthro (from https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=dm0004_1)

### FOR REPLICATION:

2. THP_analysis.do --  This file takes the clean data (from THP_cleandata.do) and runs the analysis for the paper.
NB: The code can take several days to run to reproduce all the tables in the paper because of the randomization inference and stepdown procedures. p-values in Tables 2-4-6-9 and confidence interval in Figure 2 do not fully replicate beacuse of inherent randomness in both randcmd and the stepdown procedure.

    * This file will use the following inputs
        * /dataClean/THP_clean.dta

    * This file will produce the following outputs
        * all Tables and Figures in the manuscript and online appendix.

    * commands needed:
         * pstar           (from https://github.com/PrincetonBPL/ado-gallery)
         * leebounds       (from https://github.com/PrincetonBPL/ado-gallery)
         * randcmd         (from A Young's website http://personal.lse.ac.uk/YoungA/)
         * stepdownB       (adapted from https://github.com/PrincetonBPL/ado-gallery)
         * stepdownrandcmd  (adapted from https://github.com/PrincetonBPL/ado-gallery)
         * mat2txt
         * estout
         * moremata
         * xtgraph
         * kdens
         * coefplot
         * blindschemes
         * grc1leg     (from http://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins/grc1leg/grc1leg.ado)
         * leebounds   (from https://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0364)
         * figures/coefficientPlot/coefplot_all.do

    * Latex Packages needed to compile the output:
         * siunitx
         ```Latex
         % siunitx
         \usepackage{siunitx}
         \sisetup{
	          detect-mode,
	          group-digits            = false,
	          input-symbols           = ( ) [ ] - +,
	          table-align-text-post   = false,
	          input-signs             = ,
         }
         ```
         * Add the following to the preamble
         ```Latex
         % Allow line breaks with \\ in specialcells
         \newcommand{\specialcell}[2][c]{%
	       \begin{tabular}[#1]{@{}c@{}}#2\end{tabular}
         }
         ```

Note 1: Table 2 and 3 are created from the same file, and then manually separated
Note 2: p-values in Tables 2-4-6-9 and confidence interval in Figure 2 do not fully replicate beacuse of inherent randomness in both randcmd and the stepdown procedure. (Setting the seed is not enough to ensure deterministic results)
Note 3: In order to compile these tables in Latex the `\specialcell{}` command is used in the headings, and we also use the packaage siunitx as a special column delimiter to indicate alignment at the decimal.
