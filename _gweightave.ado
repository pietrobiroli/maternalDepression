*! version 1.0.0  27may2013
* This is an add-on to egen, written by Johannes Haushofer, May 27, 2013. The command is as follows: 
* egen indexvariable = weightave(varlist) [, normby(var)]
* The output is a new variable (indexvariable) which contains a weighted average of 
* varlist. The weighted average is computed following Anderson (2011) by subtracting the mean, 
* normalizing by the standard deviation, computing the covariance matrix, inverting it, summing 
* the rows of the covariance matrix, and then weighting each variable with its corresponding 
* entry in the summed inverted covariance matrix. After that divide by the sum of the weights 
* just to normalize. 
* The "normby(var)" option, where var is a dummy variable, specifies that the standard deviation 
* through which the mean-subtracted variables are divided is computed only from those observations 
* where var = 1. For example, we often want to subtract the mean of the whole sample, but divie by 
* the standard deviation of the control group only. This can be achieved by calling: 
* egn indexvariable = weightave(varlist), normby(controldummy)
* A special case occurs when varlist has only one element. In this case this variable receives 
* weight 1, and the ouput is simply a z-scored version of that variable.
* Note that step 1 in Anderon's procedure - inverting variables so that "positive" outcomes 
* go with higher values for all variables - needs to be done by hand before calling egen weightave.
* Further note that the program does its own z-scoring (as explained above), so no need to standardize 
* variables before calling it.
